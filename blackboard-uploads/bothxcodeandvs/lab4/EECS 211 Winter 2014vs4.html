</p><p><b>Due: Feb. 12, 11:59pm</b></p></center>

<p><b><font size="+1">Objective</font>:</b>
</p><p>  In Lab 4, we will build classes for use later in the project.
  In this assignment, you will learn to:

</p><p>   [1] Work with multiple source files
<br>  [2] Practice dynamic memory allocation
<br>  [3] Design a class, including its data members and member functions
<br>  [4] Implement class member functions, including constructors and destructors
<br>  [5] Test and debug classes
<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b><font size="+1">Problem Description</font></b>

</p><p>  We will build a CMatrix class to perform matrix operations.  Your CMatrix should implement the following functions: </p>

<ul>
<li> CMatrix():  constructs a "null" (invalid) matrix </li>
<li> CMatrix(double d):  constructs a 1 x 1 CMatrix with the given value </li>
<li> CMatrix(int nrows, int ncol):  constructs a CMatrix with nrows rows and ncols  columns with all zero entries; the matrix is set to a null state if either of these are less than or equal to zero </li>
<li> CMatrix(const char* str):  constructs a CMatrix given a string input (or a null matrix if the string is invalid) </li>
<li> bool isNull():  returns whether or not the CMatrix is invalid </li>
<li> void swap(CMatrix&amp; other):  swaps the contents of this CMatrix with the given CMatrix
</li><li> double&amp; element(int row, int col):  returns the value in the indicated row and column </li>
<li> int getNRows():  returns the number of rows in the CMatrix </li>
<li> int getNCols():  returns the number of columns in the CMatrix </li>
<li> void resize(int newRows, int newCols):  resizes the CMatrix to the given size, keeping all existing elements and filling additional elements with zeros </li>
<li> ~CMatrix():  destroys the CMatrix object, deallocating any allocated memory </li>
</ul>

<p> In the same file, you should also implement a void printMatrix(CMatrix&amp; m) function that prints the given CMatrix to cout in the format described in the attached output.jpg.</p>

<p>
 You should use assert() statements to test for errors in the non-constructor member functions.  Constructors should initialize the CMatrix to a "null" state in the event of an error.
</p>

<p>
  You should submit two files:  the cmatrix.cpp source file, which should implement the above functions; and a cmatrix.h header file that defines the CMatrix class.  We have provided a sample cmatrix.h file with this assignment; you should add the line <br>
  #include "cmatrix.h" <br>
  near the top of your cmatrix.cpp file.  You may change the data members or add private/protected member functions to the provided cmatrix.h, but you should not change the definitions of the required member functions. </p>
  
  <p> When implementing your class, you may use either a double** (array of arrays) or a double* array to represent the values in the CMatrix.  When using a double* to represent a 2D array, you can access element (i, j) of the matrix at index [i * nCol + j] in the double* array. </p>
  
  <p> Also, it is easier to locate bugs if you test your code piece by piece instead of implementing all of the functions at the same time.  For this reason, you may wish to write your own matrix_driver.cpp file that constructs various CMatrix objects and tests the functions you implement, adding more and more tests as you implement more constructors and functions for the CMatrix class.  (This file should also include cmatrix.h.)  You may wish to start implementing your class with the default constructor and print function and implement more complex functions like the string constructor and resize function last. </p>

<p>Some example test cases are provided in example_test.cpp.</p>
