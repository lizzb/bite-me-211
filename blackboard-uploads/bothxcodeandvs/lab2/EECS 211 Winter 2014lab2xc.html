<p><b><font size="+1">Machine Problem MP#1: Partition a Command Line</font></b>
</p><p><b>Due: 1/29/2014 at 11:59pm</b></p></center>

<p><b><font size="+1">Objective</font>:</b>
</p><p>The purpose of this MP is to write a tool C program which can partition
a command line into segments. You will gain some experience in:
</p><p>[1] basic stream I/O;
<br>[2] C/C++ control structures;
<br>
[3] processing char arrays;
<br>
[4] VC++ programming environment.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Problem Description</font></b>
</p><p>Write a program that will read and parse a command line from the keyboard.&nbsp; More specifically, your program should do the  following: 
</p><blockquote>
<li>
Print out a welcome message once.</li>
<li>Prompt the user to enter a command line.</li>

<li>
Partition the command line into segments.</li>

<li>
Print each command segment on a different line.</li>
<li>Iterate the partitioner until you input "quit"</li>
</blockquote>
A valid segment is one of the following cases:
<ol>
<li>
a name of a variable, e.g., abc, var_1, ptr_1</li>

<li>
an operator, =, +, -, *, /, ++, --</li>

<li>
a number, e.g., 1, 1.3, 3.1415926</li>

<li>
  an array of numbers in [ ],&nbsp; e.g., [2 3 4], [1 3 4; 2 3 5; 2 4 5]</li>
</ol>
<p>To be more specific:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A  variable is any sequence of letters, digits and underscore. It starts with a  letter.</li>
  <li>Only consider the following operators : =, +, -, *, /, ++, --.</li>
  <li>Only integers and decimal numbers are acceptable as numbers. </li>
  <li> An array of numbers in [ ] can be treated as matrix. Blanks or commas are used to separate the numbers in a row. And semicolons are used to separate rows. You have to verify that the elements within [ ] are numbers or valid separators. In this project, you don't have to check if it is a valid matrix. But in a later project, you will do.</li>
  <li>The number and position of blanks in the line can be arbitrary.</li>
</ol>
If a line contains a segment that is not any of the above cases, detect it and print out an
error message, e.g., "Sorry, don't understand!".
<p>Examples:
</p><p>1.
</p><pre>Input a command line:&nbsp; res = var_1 + 3.1415
The segments are:
res
=
var_1
+
3.1415

2.</pre>
<pre>Input a command line:&nbsp; M_1 = [1 2 3; 3 4 5; 4 3 2] 
The segments are:
M_1
=
[1 2 3; 3 4 5; 4 3 2]

3.</pre>
<pre>Input a command line: This MP is 4 fun 
The segments are:
This
MP
is
4
fun

4.</pre>
<pre>Input a command line: ++a
The segments are:
++
a

5.</pre>
<pre>Input a command line:            a=b
The segments are:
a
=
b</pre>
6.
<pre>Input a command line: th(is) mp is 4 fun 
The segments are:
Sorry, don't understand!</pre>
